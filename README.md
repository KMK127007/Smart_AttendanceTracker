ü§ñ AI-Powered Student Attendance System
This is a comprehensive web application built with Streamlit that provides a modern, AI-enhanced solution for managing student attendance. The system features a dual-role interface for Admins and Students, leveraging powerful language models from Hugging Face to deliver intelligent analytics and personalized feedback.

## ‚ú® Key Features
Dual-Role Interface: A secure admin panel for management and a clean, simple dashboard for students to mark attendance.

Secure Attendance Marking: Students use a multi-step process involving a daily access code (generated by the admin) and a simulated OTP for verification.

Student Management: Admins can easily add new students and provide qualitative feedback through remarks.

AI-Generated Analytics: Admins can generate high-level summaries of attendance data, identifying trends across colleges and student levels without manually sifting through data.

Personalized AI Reports: Create detailed, constructive performance reports for individual students that combine their attendance data with admin remarks, all generated by an AI.

Student-Friendly Feedback: An AI rephrases admin remarks into positive, encouraging summaries for students to view.

Robust AI Integration: Uses the Hugging Face Inference API with a built-in local fallback mechanism. If the API fails, the app can use a locally-run t5-small model to ensure AI features remain available.

Data Persistence: Student and attendance records are stored locally in CSV files, making the application self-contained and easy to set up.
